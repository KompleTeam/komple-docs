# Installing the Library

This guide uses some libraries from CosmWasmJS to get a signing client for sending out transactions.  
To learn more about CosmWasmJS go to their [repo](https://github.com/CosmWasm/CosmWasmJS).

KompleJS can be installed with:

```bash
npm install komplejs
```

After installation, you can import the library in your project:

```typescript
import KompleClient from "komplejs";
```
