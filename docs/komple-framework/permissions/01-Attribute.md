# Attribute Permission

Attribute Permission is used for making attribute level comparisons and checks.

There are 8 types of conditions available for attribute comparison:

- Exists
- Absent
- Equal
- Not Equal
- Greater Than
- Greater Than or Equal
- Less Than
- Less Than or Equal

With combination of different conditions, complex checks can be made.

Some examples would be:

- Comparing the attack points of two different characters
- Checking if the user has a certain level for some action
- Checking if a certain trait is available in a token
