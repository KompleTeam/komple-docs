# Link Permission

Link Permission is used for checking the linked collections of a collection.

Based on the link status of a collection, it can be used in areas such as:

- While minting a token on **collection 1**, minting another token on **collection 2** if the second collection is linked to the first collection.
- Performing merge operation only if the collection to mint is linked to the collections to burn.

:::info

Only linked collections is supported at the moment. Further research will be done on linked tokens and projects.
