# Custom Permissions

Custom Permissions are permissions that are not provided by Komple Framework. They are permissions that are created by other developers/projects.

This guide will show you how to create a custom permission for Komple Framework. It is assumed that you have basic understanding of [the framework](/docs/komple-framework/overview.md).
