# Merge Module

Merge module is used for merging multiple tokens and minting new ones - burning the old tokens in the process. 

There are several inputs for this module.

- Collection IDs for mint messages
- Collection and Token IDs for burn messages
- Metadata IDs for the minted tokens

## Merging Tokens

There are three types of merging possible within the module:

- Normal merge
- Admin merge
- Permission merge

This type of merge - just as the name implies - is a standard merge operation on tokens.
