# Overview

Komple Framework is a smart contract framework for building NFT based applications using [CosmWasm](https://docs.cosmwasm.com).

With more applications coming out with NFT logic underneath, it is apparent that a better management of tokens and systems is needed on-chain.

Instead of using servers and databases to manage collections and core logic, different contracts can be orchestrated to work together. With this kind of networking, different applications and use cases can be achieved without needing to setup an off-chain architecture.

Komple Framework brings this networking idea to life by giving providing a set of contracts. These contracts can be used in different scenarios to get a certain logic implemented in the application.

We will go more in depth about each contract and their use case in the coming pages.
