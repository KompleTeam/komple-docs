After registering your official or custom modules in the project, it will automatically be available in the project's registry.

The addresses of these modules will be resolved internally but you can always query the Hub Module to get the address of a module.

To search for a module's address, you need to select `Get Module Address` from the dropdown and have the following information:

- Module name

### Module Name

This is the name you gave to your module when you registered it.

After you have filled in the information, click on the **Query Hub Module** button to search for the module's address.

Now you have the address of the module you want! You can use this address in each module's own UI to interact with the module.
